## Notes
1. I decided to use delegation in button events. With attribute 'data-type' I define the case of event (line 203 of main.js)  
2. The async/await you can find in adding a new product (line 90 of main.js)  
3. The promise I use in sorting, getting more information about the product, in product's deletion and search of product with setTimeout (find seconds there)
4. I use cookie (plugin $.cookie) to store data about products (after deletion or addition)  
5. Validation is defined with regular expressions
